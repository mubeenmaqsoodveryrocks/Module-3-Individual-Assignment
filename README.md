# Module-3-Individual-Assignment
Mubeen Maqsood
I implemented the Card 24 Game using JavaFX. I did my best to follow all the instructions for the assignment. 
I included all of the Java source code and FXML files.
I even used CSS styling in the hello-view.fxml class.
When running the code, it works fine.
